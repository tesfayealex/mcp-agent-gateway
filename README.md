# mcp-agent-gateway

This project aims to develop an autonomous agent system capable of interacting with various external services through the Method Call Protocol (MCP). The system will leverage fastmcp for implementing MCP servers and agents, and will be containerized using Docker for ease of setup and deployment.

## Project Overview
The core idea is to build intelligent agents that can perform tasks by communicating with specialized MCP servers. These servers act as adapters, translating generic MCP calls into specific API calls for services like GitHub, Google Drive, and the local filesystem. The project involves setting up the necessary environment, understanding the communication protocols, implementing agents and servers, and integrating them into a functional system.

## Key Components

    - Autonomous Agents: Intelligent entities designed to perform tasks by interacting with MCP servers.

    - MCP Servers: Services that expose external APIs (GitHub, Filesystem, Google Drive, Atlassian) via the Method Call Protocol.

    - Method Call Protocol (MCP): The standardized protocol used by agents to invoke methods on MCP servers.

    - Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication: (To be explored/implemented) Protocol for agents to communicate and collaborate with each other.

    - Knowledge Base (KB): A local mock knowledge base for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) or other agent data needs.

    - fastmcp: A framework/library used for building efficient MCP agents and servers.

    - Docker: Used for containerizing the various components (agents, servers, potentially the KB) to ensure consistent environments.

## Implementation Details
The project will utilize fastmcp for implementing both the agent logic and the MCP server functionalities. Docker will be used to package these components, allowing the entire system to be built and run in isolated containers. This approach simplifies dependency management and deployment.

## Project Phases (Based on Tasks)
The project development is structured into several phases:

    1. Environment Setup & Protocol Study: Setting up the development environment (Python/NodeJS, Git, Docker), creating the mock knowledge base structure, and gaining a deep understanding of the MCP and A2A protocols and the target MCP servers.

    2. Basic Agent & Server Implementation: Implementing a simple agent and one or more basic MCP servers using fastmcp.

    3. Protocol Implementation & Testing: Ensuring correct implementation of MCP invoke_method and response handling. Testing communication between the agent and servers.

    4. Integration with External Services: Connecting MCP servers to actual external service APIs (GitHub, Filesystem, etc.).

    5. Agent Capabilities Expansion: Developing agents with more complex reasoning and task execution capabilities, potentially incorporating RAG using the mock KB.

    6. Dockerization: Containerizing the agent(s), MCP server(s), and potentially the mock KB for streamlined deployment.

    7. System Testing & Refinement: Testing the integrated, containerized system and refining components based on results.

## Mock Knowledge Base
A directory structure for a mock knowledge base will be created to support agent capabilities requiring external information retrieval (RAG). Details on populating and accessing the mock KB will be provided separately.
